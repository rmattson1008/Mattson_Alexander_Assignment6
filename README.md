To Compile:
Navigate into /program and then use `make run` to compile and run the program. To run the program with input other than the default, compile with the `make` command and then execute `./main input.txt`

Workload:
Together, we decided on the class structure. Rachel implemented MergeSort and the Quicksort algorithms, as well as main.cpp . Sarah handled SelectionSort and HeapSort and the required classes for those algorthims. We wrote the report together.

References:
We reference the class textbook, "C++ Plus Data Structures, Nell Dale, Jones & Bartlett Learning, 6thEd., 2018" for the sorting algorithm. Further inspiration was taken from the website geeksforgeeks.org (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quicksort-using-random-pivoting/), (specifically for the split method within the QuickSort algorithm.)
