References:
We reference the class textbook, "C++ Plus Data Structures, Nell Dale, Jones & Bartlett Learning, 6thEd., 2018" for the sorting algorithm. Further inspiration was taken from the website geeksforgeeks.org (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quicksort-using-random-pivoting/), (specifically for the split method within the QuickSort algorithm.)
